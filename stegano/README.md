Description
You're part of an underground car tuning crew in Tunisia. One of your crew members has sent an image to the group showing his next car project. He claims there's a secret message hidden inside the image - possibly details about a rare parts supplier, coordinates to an exclusive meet-up, or specs for his upcoming build.
However, when you try to open the attached file tunning.jpg, it won't display properly. The image appears to be corrupted or damaged.
