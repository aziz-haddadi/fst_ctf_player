Description
My friend Yassine has a regular credit card with La Poste Tunisienne.
One morning he received an official-looking email titled “Mise à jour de votre relevé de compte – Octobre 2025” with a single attachment.
He double-clicked it, enabled the content because “it looked important”, and… his PC has never been the same since.
Calculator keeps popping up, strange messages appear, and he swears something is listening on his machine.
I managed to recover the exact email he received .
