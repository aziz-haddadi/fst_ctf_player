**Description** 
You're a security analyst monitoring network traffic for a local Tunisian tech company. Recently, the network monitoring system flagged unusual activity from one of the workstations in the development department.
Upon investigation, you captured network traffic from the suspicious machine and saved it as a PCAP file. At first glance, everything seems normal - just regular DNS queries for domain name resolution. However, the sheer volume of DNS requests from this single machine is raising red flags.
Your colleague mentions: "That workstation has been making way too many DNS queries... like, A LOT. More than any normal user would need. Something feels off."
Your task is to analyze the provided  file and extract the flag !!
